TODO

This project is a follow on from the use of <a href="https://github.com/davidainslie/play-scala-mybatis-kissthinker">Play/Scala/MyBatis</a>, which has a full description of coding with BDD.
All explanations leading up to MyBatis are relevant here.
To help you on this application, please read up to discussion of the use of MyBatis and then switch back here where Mongodb is used instead, in conjunction with ReactiveMongo.
Note there is also a Hibernate version.
