Demo/Tutorial of Scala/Play/Reactivemongo Application
==========================================================

Front to back demo/tutorial application of taking a BDD approach to Scala stack technologies with Reactivemongo on the backend
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Application built with the following technologies:

- Scala 2.11.1

- SBT 0.13.5

- Play 2.2.0

- Reactivemongo 0.10.0

and including

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript/CoffeeScript, JQuery, Ajax, Twitter Bootstrap

Introduction
------------

This project is a follow on from the use of <a href="https://github.com/davidainslie/play-scala-mybatis-kissthinker">Play/Scala/MyBatis</a>, which has a full description of coding with BDD.
All explanations leading up to MyBatis are relevant here.
To help you on this application, please read up to discussion of the use of MyBatis and then switch back here where Mongodb is used instead, in conjunction with ReactiveMongo.
Note there is also a Hibernate version.

Setup
-----

Upon cloning this project (or downloading and decompressing the zip) you can run the application (before viewing the code) if you have Play installed.
Don't have Play (or just need more information) then goto:
http://www.playframework.com
and
http://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.2.0/Installing (where as of writing, the current version of Play is 2.2.0)

Specs
-----
First take a look at the specs.
They can be run individually in your IDE or from SBT command line console using the "test" command.
There are both unit and integration specs.

TODO
And I mean TODO i.e. I've not even started writing any code yet. What can I say! I'm busy!
